<p>Inspired by our conversations about memory and nostalgia, this website was designed with some relatively old school tech and visuals. It is very image-heavy (necessarily, to display hundreds of visually-heavy projects), and is best viewed with internet running at a decent clip to load and view them all. Due to the format of most of the static scenes, we also recommend viewing in landscape (wide) mode, espcially on smaller screens. While a mouse isn't necessary, it does expand your opportunity for discovery.</p>
<p>Most of the image navigation on this site works like point and click video games: Follow the arrows, but also look for hidden routes and animations. The elevator (and stairs if you can find them) move you between floors. If you get lost, try visiting the <a href="map.html">map</a> page.</p>
<p>Clicking on the work within the perspective views should bring you to an undistorted middle view of that portion of the gallery, and further clicks will get you to a full-sized reproduction of the work, along with attribution information.</p>
